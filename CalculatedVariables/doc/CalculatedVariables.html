    <h1 size="+3">Calculated Variables</h1><br>
    <br>
    by: Piotr Nikiel, Oct-Nov 2018<br>
    Updated August 2021<br>
    <br>
    <h1>Overview and end-user documentation<br>
    </h1>
    <h2>Preface</h2>
    A lot of concepts and work done in the context of quasar's
    CalculatedVariables module has been inspired by V.Filimonov's
    "CalculatedItems" concept in the CANopen OPC-UA server.<br>
    I'd like to acknowledge his contribution as my inspiration (even
    though the CalculatedVariables module is designed entirely from
    scratch and using original architecture as well as different
    concepts and technologies).<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <p>A quasar-based OPC-UA server is based on a model of a system it
      is made for. This model is called a design. The model explains (in
      terms of quasar classes, variables etc.) what sources and sinks of
      information the system can publish or digest.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Often it is practical to add supplementary sources of information
      - like Calculated Variables - on top of what the model already
      provides. The reasons for doing this are often the following:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the system already provides information which is expressed in
        quantities different than requested by users.<br>
        Example: an OPC-UA server is built for a device which measures
        period of a repetitive process, but the users prefer frequency
        instead.<br>
        Solution: a Calculated Variable might be added to the server
        with a simple reciprocal (y=1/x) formula to compute frequency in
        terms of period.</li>
      <li>the system already provides information but in another unit. <br>
      </li>
      <li>the system provides raw (e.g. uncalibrated) information.<br>
        Example: an OPC-UA server publishes data from Analog to Digital
        Converter. This is raw information though.<br>
        Solution: a Calculated Variable might be added to provide for
        gain and offset calibration.</li>
      <li>similarly to the example above, the ADC might have the value
        from a conversion of e.g. a temperature sensor. A Calculated
        Variable might be attached with a formula that recomputes the
        ADC value (in volts) into temperature.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Meta-functions and meta-operators (dollar signs in the formulas)</h2>
    <p>It is often practical to perform some sort of elaboration of
      configured formulas before they are given to be compiled by the
      formula parser. Such elaboration steps are achieved by placing
      dollar-sign operators and functions in the formulas. For all
      examples below, the following quasar design diagram is used:<br>
    </p>
    <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="sample_design.png" alt=""
      width="10%"><br>
    <h3> $thisObjectAddress</h3>
    $thisObjectAddress evaluates to the string address of the object
    under which the calculated variable was instantiated. It finds a
    very practical application to build generalized formulas, which can
    be applied "under" multiple places in the address-space, so
    $thisObjectAddress serves as the relative pointer to the object
    address.<br>
    Using the design as above, the following config file shows a sample
    application:<br>
    <br>
    <pre class="mycode">	&lt;TestClass name="tc"&gt;<br>		&lt;CalculatedVariable name="test_var_multiplied" value="$thisObjectAddress.testVariable * 1000" /&gt;<br>	&lt;/TestClass&gt;<br></pre>
    <h3> $parentObjectAddress(numLevelsUp=N)</h3>
    $parentObjectAddress is a generalization of $thisObjectAddress. For
    N=0 it evaluates to $thisObjectAddress, for N=1 to its parent object
    and so on.<br>
    Using the design as above, the following config file shows a sample
    application:<br>
    <br>
    <pre class="mycode">	&lt;TestClass name="tc"&gt;<br>		&lt;TestSubClass name="tsc"&gt;<br>			&lt;CalculatedVariable name="test_var_multiplied" value="$parentObjectAddress(numLevelsUp=1).testVariable * 1000" /&gt;<br>		&lt;/TestSubClass&gt;<br>	&lt;/TestClass&gt;<br><br></pre>
    <h3>$applyGenericFormula(formula)</h3>
    <p>$applyGenericFormula is used in the context of generalized
      function templates and <a moz-do-not-send="true"

    </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="Generalized_formula_templates"></a>Generalized formula
      templates<br>
    </h2>
    Multiple sensors of same type are likely to use same formulas (with
    possibly different calibration constants). Thus it is economical to
    share formulas between them if configuration file
    readibility/clarity would profit.<br>
    <br>
    The basic application of generalized formula templates is composed
    of the following steps:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>defining the generalized formula at the top of the
        configuration file using the CalculatedVariableGenericFormula
        XML element</li>
      <li>applying the formula at the point of use using
        $applyGenericFormula meta-function.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Technically, the job done by quasar for applying the formula at
      the point of use boils down to pasting the formula in place of the
      meta-function. In the future, extending this operation by optional
      arguments, might be considered.<br>
    </p>
    <p>An example of the generalized formula template from a real system
      (CERN - ATLAS DCS - New Small Wheel project, courtesy of P.
      Tzanis) is given. The generalized formula is put at the top of the
      configuration file:<br>
    </p>
    <pre class="mycode"><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"><pre class="code-java">&lt;CalculatedVariableGenericFormula name=<span class="code-quote">"thermistorTemperature"</span>
      formula=<span class="code-quote">"1/( 3.3540154*10^(-3)+(2.5627725*10^(-4)*log(1000*$thisObjectAddress.value/500))+(2.0829210*10^(-6)*(log(1000*$thisObjectAddress.value/500))^2)+(7.3003206*10^(-8)*(log(1000*$thisObjectAddress.value/500))^3)) -273.15"</span>/&gt;</pre></pre>
    <br>
    As can be seen, the formula profits from $thisObjectAddress
    meta-function which enables its reuse at any place of the
    configuration (so, consequently, the address-space) which has a
    sibling variable called "value" (which, in the case of the
    particular application, is the converted voltage expressed in
    volts).<br>
    <br>
    Then, the application of the formula is done in the following way:<br>
    <br>
    <pre class="mycode"><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"><pre class="code-java">&lt;AnalogInput id=<span class="code-quote">"0"</span> name=<span class="code-quote">"GBTX1_TEMP"</span> enableCurrentSource=<span class="code-quote">"<span class="code-keyword">true</span>"</span> &gt; &lt;CalculatedVariable name=<span class="code-quote">"temperature"</span> value=<span class="code-quote">"$applyGenericFormula(thermistorTemperature)"</span> /&gt; &lt;/AnalogInput&gt; <br>&lt;AnalogInput id=<span class="code-quote">"1"</span> name=<span class="code-quote">"GBTX2_TEMP"</span> enableCurrentSource=<span class="code-quote">"<span class="code-keyword">true</span>"</span> &gt; &lt;CalculatedVariable name=<span class="code-quote">"temperature"</span> value=<span class="code-quote">"$applyGenericFormula(thermistorTemperature)"</span> /&gt; &lt;/AnalogInput&gt;</pre></pre>
    <h2>CalculatedVariables logging and tracing</h2>
    CalculatedVariables module has its own LogIt component called
    "CalcVars".<br>
    <br>
    As it's the case with any LogIt logging component, its log levels
    can be configured via the address-space as well as in the
    configuration file. The latter is often needed because most of
    potential issues (formula errors) would happen at the server
    initialization, i.e. before it is possible and practical to raise
    verbosity using the address-space. <br>
    <br>
    Thus, in case of issues with formulas, it is advised to put the
    CalcVars log level to TRC, for instance by means of the XML
    configuration:<br>
    <br>
    <pre class="mycode">        &lt;StandardMetaData&gt;<br>                &lt;Log&gt;<br>                        &lt;ComponentLogLevels&gt;<br>                                &lt;ComponentLogLevel componentName="CalcVars" logLevel="TRC" /&gt;<br>                        &lt;/ComponentLogLevels&gt;<br>                 &lt;/Log&gt;<br>        &lt;/StandardMetaData&gt;<br><br></pre>
    <h2>Escaping variable names containing dashes ("-") and slashes
      ("/")</h2>
    <p>Users of quasar-based servers sometimes choose to name their
      quasar objects (i.e. the <i>name</i> attribute of XML elements in
      the configuration files) with names containing dashes or slashes.<br>
      This is legit in the quasar world. However, it poses some problems
      if CalculatedVariables inputs connect to such named objects (i.e.
      its variables).<br>
    </p>
    <p>Imagine the following config file:<br>
    </p>
    <pre class="mycode">&lt;MyDevice name="Bus1/Device2-A"&gt;<br>  &lt;CalculatedVariable name="calibrationConstant" value="2.35"/&gt;<br>&lt;/MyDevice&gt;<br><br></pre>
    <br>
    Such a config file is fine; among different address-space entities
    instantiated it'd have the CalculatedVariable under address
    "Bus1/Device2-A.calibrationConstant".<br>
    However, now imagine that somewhere "later" in the config file,
    another CalculatedVariable would be introduced and it would refer to
    the calibrationConstant:<br>
    <br>
    <pre class="mycode">&lt;CalculatedVariable name="voltage" value="X -&nbsp; Bus1/Device2-A.calibrationConstant"/&gt;</pre>
    <br>
    A problem is clearly seen: in the formula, it is impossible to
    distinguish if the dashes "-" and slashes "/" refer to input
    variable names or the subtraction and/or division operators (in
    simpler cases like in this example one could "guess" the meaning but
    in general quasar architecture prefers to be more explicit rather
    than to guess). Note that due to the grammar imposed by the parser
    engine, the precedence of dashes and slashes will always be given to
    operators rather than operands.<br>
    <br>
    Therefore one needs to escape the dash and slash signs in case these
    are to refer to variable names. Thus, the aforementioned example
    would be fixed this way:<br>
    <br>
    <pre class="mycode">&nbsp;&lt;CalculatedVariable name="voltage" value="X -&nbsp; Bus1\/Device2\-A.calibrationConstant"/&gt;</pre>
    <br>
    <b>Note</b> that those using $thisObjectAddress and/or
    $parentObjectAddress to derive the input variable address do not
    have to do anything because both of the meta-functions will escape
    dashes and slashes behind the scenes.<br>
    <h2>Examples<br>
    </h2>
    <h3>NTC sensors: converting resistance into temperature in Celsius
      and Fahrenheit degrees<br>
    </h3>
    <p>Imagine that a device can measure resistance of a connected
      resistor. If the resistor happens to be a NTC temperature probe,
      then one can find the temperature in function of resistance:<br>
    </p>
    <p>T = T0 * B / (T0 * ln(R/R0) + B)<br>
    </p>
    <p>where T0 is typically 298.15K (that is, +25 deg C in Kelvin
      degrees), B is the so called B constant of a NTC probe (often
      3977K) and R0 is the resistance at T0.<br>
      The variable in the example is R, and that is the cache-variable
      that gets updated by your OPC-UA server device logic.<br>
      Let's assume that the OPC-UA address of the variable is
      NTC1.resistance <br>
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, anywhere below NTC1 declaration in your config file,
      you can instantiate a CalculatedVariable that will recompute the
      measured resistance into temperature expressed in Kelvin degrees.
      In the example below we also add some CalculatedVariables to hold
      B, T0 and R0 constants.<br>
    </p>
    <pre class="mycode">&lt;CalculatedVariable name="T0" value="298.15"/&gt;<br>&lt;CalculatedVariable name="B" value="3977"/&gt;<br>&lt;CalculatedVariable name="R0" value="10E3"/&gt;<br>&lt;CalculatedVariable name="temperatureK" value="T0*B/(T0*ln(NTC1.resistance/R0)+B)" /&gt;</pre>
    <p>We also add two Calculated Variables that will recomputer Kelvins
      into Celsius degrees and Fahrenheit degrees:<br>
    </p>
    <pre class="mycode">&lt;CalculatedVariable name="temperatureC" value="temperatureK-273.15"/&gt;<br>&lt;CalculatedVariable name="temperatureF" value="temperatureC*1.8+32"/&gt;
</pre>
    <p>In addition, we can add a boolean variable which subjectively
      indicates whether it's warm enough. It's an example of usage of
      logical operators as well as isBoolean attribute:<br>
    </p>
    <pre class="mycode">&lt;CalculatedVariable name="isWarmEnough" value="temperatureC &gt; 20" isBoolean="true" /&gt;<br></pre>
    <h3>CalculatedVariable attached to multiple different quasar
      entities</h3>
    <p>This example shall illustrate that a CalculatedVariable can be
      attached (i.e. its inputs might be) different quasar entities such
      as: cache-variables, free-variables, other calculated-variables
      and even config-entries (if they are of some numeric data-type).<br>
    </p>
    <pre class="mycode">	&lt;TestClass name="tc" configentry="125"/&gt;<br>	&lt;FreeVariable name="free_variable" type="Double"/&gt;<br>	&lt;CalculatedVariable name="a_calc_var" value="500" /&gt;<br>	&lt;CalculatedVariable<br>		name="sum_of_free_cache_variables_and_configentry" <br>		value="free_variable + tc.testVariable + tc.configentry - a_calc_var" /&gt;<br></pre>
    <p>As can be seen, the last calculated variable is a function
      computed of values of many different quasar entities which all
      corresponds to address-space variables.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Counter-examples</h2>
    <h3>Place no white-space between unary operation (e.g. a function)
      and the parenthesis around its operand</h3>
    <p>Note that it is illegal (i.e. will be refused at configuration
      loading) to put any whitespace between unary operation (function?)
      and the operands, e.g. this is legal:<br>
    </p>
    <pre class="mycode">&lt;CalculatedVariable name="V300" value="cos(x + 1.4)"/&gt;</pre>
    <br>
    and this is illegal:<br>
    <pre class="mycode">&lt;CalculatedVariable name="V300" value="cos (x + 1.4)"/&gt;</pre>

    <h1>Advanced documentation for quasar developers</h1>
    <h2>Selection of expression parser</h2>
    <p>There exist many open-source parsers potentially suitable for the
      feature. At the time of writing, a good overview was present at <a
href="https://github.com/ArashPartow/math-parser-benchmark-project">https://github.com/ArashPartow/math-parser-benchmark-project</a>
      .<br>
    </p>
    <p>The author has evaluated three parsers from the list:<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk/">ExprTk</a><br>
        It made an excellent overall impression. However, due to very
        intensive use of templates, the compilation time has been
        significant (i.e. its inclusion would triple(!!) the whole
        compilation time of a simple quasar server). That unfavourable
        property has made the quasar team to look for another solution.</li>
      <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/atmsp/">ATMSP</a><br>
        The initial code review has shown that the parser uses
        setjmp()/longjmp() which has been considered unfavourable for
        quasar servers.</li>
      <li><a href="http://beltoforion.de/article.php?a=muparser">muParser</a><br>
        muParser demonstrated decent performance while it has all the
        features required by the Calculated Variables feature.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Overview of feature implementation</h2>
    <p>An UML class diagram is presented below.<br>
    </p>
    <img src="CalculatedVariablesClassDiagram.png" alt="UML"
      height="765" width="1098"><br>
    <h2>Classes rationale</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>ChangeNotifyingVariable - can emit notifications whenever the
        variable changed value. Applicable to any data type. Can be used
        with multiple notification receivers. Can be used for
        applications different than CalculatedVariables.</li>
      <li>ParserVariable - stores current numeric variable value as a
        plain double type, and therefore can be coupled as a mu::Parser
        variable. (Sidenote: mu::Parser doesn't know anything about
        OPC-UA and without such arrangement it wouldn't know how to
        access a double from UaVariant, neither to know whether the
        value is correct, etc.).</li>
      <ul>
        <li>notifyingVariable - is the pointer to a
          ChangeNotifyingVariable which notifies this particular
          ParserVariable on change,</li>
        <li>notifiedVariables - the list of all CalculatedVariables that
          use this particular ParserVariable in formulas.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>CalculatedVariable - it's the OPC-UA variable defined by a
        formula. It's a subclass of ChangeNotifyingVariable because its
        output can in turn be used as an input to another Calculated
        Variable (so it must be able to emit notifications on change).</li>
      <li>Engine - puts all things together. It supplies methods for
        usage in Configuration module:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>instantiateCalculatedVariable - called whenerver
          CalculatedVariable() entry is found in the config file,</li>
        <li>registerVariableForCalculatedVariables - called whenever any
          cache-variable of suitable design properties (numeric and
          scalar) is inserted into the OPC-UA address-space<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Overview of information flow</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>All cache-variables instantiated by quasar Configuration
        module are of ChangeNotifyingVariable type or its subclasses.<br>
      </li>
      <li>When quasar Configuration determines that given cache-variable
        variable looks suitable to be used as a formula input (i.e. is
        numeric and it's scalar), it would add a ChangeListener and a
        corresponding ParserVariable. The ChangeListener will (once
        potentially invoked in future) call setValue() on given
        ParserVariable. <br>
      </li>
      <li>When device logic or an OPC-UA client writes to a suitable
        cache-variable, the setValue() of ParserVariable bound to the
        cache-variable will be called. It will store the new value and
        status in corresponding fields and then call update() on
        relevant (i.e. those which use given parser variable as an
        input) CalculatedVariable variables. <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Synchronization, re-entrance, multi-threading<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The CalculatedVariables module is closely tied to the
      AddressSpace of a quasar-based server. <br>
      For instance, the recalculation of an associated calculated
      variable is done within the call to a setter of a variable that it
      depends on. <br>
    </p>
    <p>It must be emphasized that AddressSpace is brutally
      multi-threaded. At the same time, the following thread families
      would be doing work on AddressSpace objects:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>sampling threads which sample current values of
        cache-variables to which any client subscribes. Those threads
        are run by chosen OPC-UA backend and their number is highly
        dependent on backend's configuration (i.e. ServerConfig.xml) as
        well as possibly on number of connected clients and the set of
        data they subscribe to.</li>
      <li>server's OPC-UA requests processing threads. Those threads are
        run by chosen OPC-UA backend and similarly to sampling threads,
        their number depends on many factors. Those threads process e.g.
        Write service requests, so that an OPC-UA client can write to
        given variable.</li>
      <li>device logic (or other user threads). Those threads are
        instantiated by server developers and configured by end-users.
        They typically push data to the address-space.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    In the context of Calculated Variables, there are two obvious
    critical section types:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>possible calls to variable setters of the same variable coming
        from different threads.<br>
        The worries here are the following:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>there might be a clash in storage of value and status, as
          both of them are necessary to perform the calculation and (to
          author's knowledge) such an assignment is never atomic by
          default. So a recalculation might take value stored by one
          thread and status from another, or on a 32-bit machine (since
          double is 64-bits) even take partially stored value.</li>
        <li>it's not entirely clear if calls to mu::Parser::Eval are
          re-entrant.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>possible concurrent calls from different threads to variable
        setters of different variables which are used in the same
        formula.<br>
        The worries here are the following:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>the parser might attempt to use the value when it is being
          assigned to (and that is not atomic)</li>
        <li>it's not entirely clear if calls to mu::Parser::Eval are
          re-entrant.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Having analyzed the problem and trying to propose a guaranteed
      dead-lock free solution, the author proposes to form disjoint
      subgraphs of the calculation graph and synchronize per each
      subgraph.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Let's look at an example for which the calculation graph is like
      in the picture below.<br>
    </p>
    <img src="SynchronizationExample.png" alt="Synchronization example"
      height="364" width="614"><br>
    PV stands for ParserVariable, those are all variables that can be
    used as inputs in a CalculatedVariable formula.<br>
    CV stands for CalculatedVariable. Note that every CV is also a PV
    because the output of one formula can be used as an input to another
    formula.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Case 1: ignore CV4 (violet node and arrows)</h3>
    Case 1 would happen if we defined the following Calculated Variables
    in the config file (the particular operators - e.g. addition,
    multiplication - do not matter):<br>
    <br>
    CV1 = PV1 + PV2<br>
    CV2 = CV1*PV3 + PV2<br>
    CV3 = 3.14 * PV4<br>
    <br>
    In this case the implementation will form two domains of mutual
    exclusion (called synchronizers):<br>
    <ul>
      <li>1st one, which will provide exclusive access to setters of
        PV1, PV2 and PV3 (e.g. if any thread would enter setter of any
        of {PV1, PV2, PV3} all other threads willing to do the same
        would need to wait)</li>
      <li>2nd one, which will provide exclusive access to setter of PV4</li>
    </ul>
    <p>PV5 would not get a synchronizer because it's output is not used
      by anything; in fact PV5 would be optimized out after the
      configuration process is finished.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Case 2: CV4 is added</h3>
    Now let's add CV4 to the picture.<br>
    <br>
    This (apparently) small extension actually does change a lot in the
    multi-threading schema: now one mutual exclusion domain gets formed
    which covers all possible setters. <br>
    Though such a scenario is rather unlikely to be seen, server
    developers and users should be aware of this relation.<br>
    <br>

    <h2>muParser distribution model</h2>
    <p>The muParser is distributed along quasar in an amalgamated way.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In quasar repo, you can go to:<br>
      CalculatedVariables/ext_components/<br>
      where you will find a script "clone_and_amalgamate_muparser.sh"
      which will perform cloning of muParser and then amalgamation.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Note that the particular version of muParser as well as
      accompanying amalgamation utility is fixed so there is no reason
      to run the script without changing the version.<br>
